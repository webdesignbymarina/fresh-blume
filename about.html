        <p>Welcome to Fresh Blume — a cleaning service built on good energy, care, and a genuine passion for creating peaceful, refreshing spaces. My name is Zoë Tucker, a lifelong clean freak raised in an exceptionally tidy Indiana home, and I've always believed that a clean environment can make life feel a little lighter and a lot less stressful.
            <br>
Fresh Blume is proudly inclusive, queer-friendly, and judgment-free. My goal is to support homeowners, apartment renters, and small businesses throughout Salt Lake County by providing reliable, detail-oriented cleaning that helps you feel comfortable and unburdened in your space.
<br>
I work solo for most cleanings, but I also have a small team available when additional support is needed. What sets my service apart is my eye for detail, strong work ethic, and flexible approach tailored to each client's needs.
<br>
Outside of cleaning, I'm a traveler from Indiana, a musician, and an entrepreneur who enjoys snowboarding, yoga, hiking, and a good board-game night — all things that inspire the calm and creativity I bring into every space I clean.
<br>
At Fresh Blume, my mission is simple: to help your space feel fresh, grounded, and truly yours again. 🌷</p>
